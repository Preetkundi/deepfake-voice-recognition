## üöÄ Features

- **Robust Audio Preprocessing**  
  - MFCC (13 coefficients) + delta + delta‚Äìdelta features  
  - Data augmentation: time-stretch (0.8√ó, 1.2√ó) and pitch-shift (¬±2 semitones)  
  - Padding/truncation to the 95th-percentile sequence length  

- **High‚ÄêPerformance BiLSTM Model**  
  - Bidirectional LSTM layers (128 ‚Üí 64 units) with masking  
  - Dropout & Dense layers for regularization  
  - Adam optimizer & categorical cross-entropy loss  
  - Class-weight balancing, EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau  
  - Threshold-based three-way decision: **Real**, **Review**, **Fake**  

- **Evaluation & Thresholding**  
  - 80/20 train/test split with stratification  
  - Precision/Recall/F‚ÇÅ analysis  
  - Automatic branch: 100 % accuracy on ‚Äúclear‚Äù cases
